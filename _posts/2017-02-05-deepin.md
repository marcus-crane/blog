title: Speeding up Deepin Linux

A few weeks back, I tried out [Deepin Linux](https://www.deepin.org/en/) and it's actually quite nice! It definitely has one of the nicest desktop environments that I've seen from a Linux distro and yes, perhaps even more so than [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) in my opinion.

Now that said, it also has a few major issues but nothing that can't be fixed.

### Package mirrors are broken

By default, Deepin ships with the official CDN mirror enabled and holy heck is it slow. I'm talking outright unusable but that's not so bad because there's a mirror selector...

that does absolutely nothing. Click any mirror you like but nothing will actually change.

It's not like it would matter anyway because there's not a single mirror that my network considers "Fast".

The Australian mirror, which Deepin blogged about adding to the list would be faster if they had actually added it to the official list or even the OS.

Let's fix that! I'll assume you know at least how to use a terminal and `nano` if you're reading this.

You'll want to head to `/apt/` and open up `sources.list` with `nano sources.list`.

You should see a file that looks like so:

{% highlight sh %}
deb [by-hash=force] http://packages.deepin/deepin unstable main contrib non-free
deb-src http://packages.deepin.com/deepin unstable main contrib non-free
{% endhighlight %}

Depending on where you live, you'll want to visit the mirror list [here](https://www.deepin.org/en/mirrors/packages/) and choose whichever is closest to you.

The Australian Colocity Mirror can be found [here](http://mirror.colocity.com/deepin/) and still isn't listed on the site which is a pain.

Simply comment out the two entries `sources.list` and create a new line that swaps out the URL for the nearby mirror.

Mine looks like so with the Japanese mirror included (but commented out) just in case I might ever need a package that hasn't been updated for example.

{% highlight sh %}
# A nice and fast Australian mirror
deb http://mirror.colocity.com/deepin unstable main contrib non-free

# Tsukuba WIDE Public Mirror Service
# deb http://ftp.tsukuba.wide.ad.jp/Linux/deepin unstable main contrib non-free

# Slow as heck official mirror (don't even bother...)
# deb [by-hash=force] http://packages.deepin/deepin unstable main contrib non-free
# deb-src http://packages.deepin.com/deepin unstable main contrib non-free
{% endhighlight %}

I feel like there was some other issue I had but I can't remember since I don't actually have Deepin installed anymore. I didn't get bored of it, I just needed macOS again (and graphics drivers + battery life) for some stuff.

Oh and while it may be tempting since Deepin is based on Debian, DO NOT use the Debian mirrors because, as I found out, they'll detect unknown packages like your desktop environment, file manager etc and rip them all out leaving you screwed!
