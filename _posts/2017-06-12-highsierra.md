I've recently been trying out the High Sierra Developer Beta which is nice and, well, not that different than regular Sierra so far.

There are a few bugs with programs I've encountered which you may find handy to know if you're considering jumping on board.

This won't be a complete list and I'll probably update it as I continue to discover more issues.

## Brew

This entry is mainly a reminder that Brew isn't guaranteed to work with a beta OS like High Sierra.

I've had the above issue with installing Wireshark (site binaries are fine) but Brew itself is perfectly operational with all other installations so far.

## Dashlane

Dashlane is a password manager and one of the programs I use most often. It currently just opens and closes repeatedly if you try to run it. In the meantime, there's a [web app](https://app.dashlane.com) you can use if that's your thing.

## Google Drive

Do you like syncing your files seamlessly between your desktop and The Cloudâ„¢? Well, it looks like you're outta luck because you can't installed Google Drive on High Sierra just yet.

It seems that the installer has no idea that APFS is a thing yet and as such, freaks out demanding that you provide an HFS+ drive. You might be able to get away with formatting a USB drive to HFS+ but do you really want to carry one everywhere?

On the bright side, at least you can just download everything as one big zip file.

## Kitematic

This one isn't bad at all but it's a little annoying.

The top menu bar which is normally custom themed, glitched out visually rendering a grey bar. You can still drag the window around normally and everything else works fine so it's not really an issue.
