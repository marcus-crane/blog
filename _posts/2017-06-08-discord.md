I received a message from someone at about 3am on June 8th and I mistakenly thought I received it through Discord. In hindsight, that didn't make sense since I didn't actually have Discord running.

Anyway, I started it up and the iconic spinny logo (which I now know is actually just a webm video) appeared...

and kept spinning... and spinning... and ok, obviously something is up here so it's time to do some investigating üïµÔ∏è

The first step which you should always do is check out the website to see if they have a status page

The same error appeared for [https://status.discordapp.com](https://status.discordapp.com) which defeats the entire purpose of having a status page. Well, perhaps we can confirm what exactly is giving the Discord app trouble by checking out `Console.app`. Oh and shoutout to [@samjarman](https://twitter.com/samjarman) for reminding me the day before that it was a thing.

Well, it's not too surprising considering I couldn't access the main site but as we can see, there's an `HTTP Load Failed` error!

Hmm, at this point, I decided to check if it was just me having this issue. There was no mention of any issues by [@discordapp](https://twitter.com/discordapp) but that doesn't mean there's nothing at all. In times like this, [search.twitter.com](https://search.twitter.com) becomes your best friend.

Sorting by latest, I came across at least a few users:

Well, it's not just me then! Now that we know it's not just a local issue, we can start to look further afield. Using a service like [isup.me](https://isup.me) tells us that Discord isn't down for everyone but obviously it's down for others in New Zealand so the issue must lay somewhere in between.

Well, that means we've got a solid case to bust out `traceroute` which will list all the servers that our connection routes through when attempting to reach Discord.

The annoying part with this traceroute is that it completes. That's great of course but it'd be a bit more obvious if it just failed at a specific server. To get around this, I tried the very scientific method of visiting each IP address starting from bottom to top.

The last 2 timed out while all the previous entries returned nothing. That's not bad of course, it just means that those servers aren't serving anything on Port `80` so chances are we can ignore them. Since the last two are attempting to respond with HTML but failing, we can assume that's where the error lays.

The highlighted entry from the screenshot above is the earliest server that times out so it makes sense to assume that's where the problem begins or else it would just route our request on to the next server. Let's see what we can find out about `198.41.236.253`.

Ahh, a Cloudflare server? That makes sense. For whose who haven't heard of it, Cloudflare provides a few services such as DDoS protection to mitigate attacks and a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for distributing services around the world.

In the case of Discord, Cloudflare would be mirroring their content so we can connect to a local server rather than waiting for our connection to route all the way to the US which wouldn't be as fast.

Now that we know that, it's worth having a look where exactly this Cloudflare is and surprise, surprise, it's located in Auckland!

Now it makes sense why Discord isn't mentioning this issue because it's not actually a Discord issue, it's a Cloudflare issue! So, how about we check the Cloudflare status page instead?

Would ya look at that, it's `Re-routed`. That's not explicitly an error but we've got users in New Zealand having issues on the left and a New Zealand server with a status other than `Operational` on the right so I think it's safe to conclude that the issue resides with Cloudflare (the middlemen and middlewomen, geddit?).

After a while, Cloudflare changed back to `Operational` and the entire route changed aside from the first two (my router and ISP respectively) and the final address.

Initially the traffic was passing from my house up to Auckland and then to San Francisco but now it passes through a bunch of [bogon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogon_filtering) addresses and one address owned by [IX Australia](https://www.ix.asn.au/) before popping up at the same Cloudflare address in San Francisco.

Ah well, things are back in order so I can go back to chatting on Discord. I never received any acknowledgement from their Twitter account but I sent an email to their engineering department to follow up.

At least, their mail server told me that engineering was a valid email address. As for how I found that out, well, that's a blog post for another day (or you can just search `telnet smtp`).

If I get a reply back, I'll post an update with their response.
