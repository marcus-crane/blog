The other day, I was at the Wellington Train Station and I noticed something funny was up with the monitors that display the timetables.

Yeah! Those totally look like commands that a program would read! I would call it a rare glimpse into how they automate the voicing.

Here's another photo from shortly after.

You'll notice a macOS program called RailTalk. For the life of me, I can't find any information about it.

Out of curosity, I emailed [Metlink](http://metlink.org.nz) to see if they could tell me more about it.

It was only a day ago so I haven't heard anything yet but I'll keep you updated.

### Update 1

The Metlink Service Centre replied, informing me that the train operator [Transdev](http://transdevwellington.co.nz) would be able to shed some more light on my question.

It’s currently Saturday so it’s unlikely I’ll have any updates but at least we’re headed in the right direction!

### Update 2

I'm just doing an update for this while I move my blog across to its current platform.

I never heard back from Transdev, even though they sent an automated email saying I would hear a response within 5 days.
