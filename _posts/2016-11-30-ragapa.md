So, I'm sitting at the library using the public WiFi and I visit an unsecured site.

Bam, injected ad frame. What?!? I run Common Sense 2016, the most up to date antivirus available!

Even my own site is suffering from this rather ugly defacement! Bah, and people think I'm silly for enabling https even on my static sites. If a site has it enabled, these ads can't insert themselves midway.

I realised later on that I had removed [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) while testing out some different extensions, and forgotten to reinstall it, which is why I'd never seen these injections before.

## If it's not me, maybe it's the network!

I had a look in my extensions. Nothing out of place there. A quick poke around the most obvious places turned up zilch so perhaps it was someone, or something on the network?

I spun up [Wireshark](https://wireshark.org) and watched the network spew out heaps of requests. It was a public city WiFi after all but thankfully, you can filter by `http` to gain some more clarity.

Oooh, what's that?

Hmm, `GET /api/adscript.jsp`? That looks promising.

Perhaps an infected device is serving it up? What if it's someone hijacking unsecured requests and inserting their own monetisation? I gotta know more!

Thanks to my rookie skills with nmap, I remembered that I could run a scan on it, not just for open ports but also details about its OS as well.

`Too many fingerprints match this host to give specific OS details.` Well, so much for that approach.

Maybe the actual ad script itself can give me some clues?

## It's usually quicker if you look at what's right in front of you

I loaded up a non-secure site and poked around the DOM.

Oh... That address has [Citylink Wellington](http://www.citylink.co.nz/) in it who run the actual network itself. I guess it's nothing malicious after all but still a pain in the ass.

I kept coming across `ragapa` references, such as `div class=ragapaBottomImage` and `script src=http://adapi.ragapa.com` but in wanting to play with Wireshark, I skipped the obvious path of just searching the name. How is that any fun though!

It didn't take me long before I found an article about RaGaPa.

They're a company who provide devices that inject ads into WiFi hotspots. In this case, the entire city wide WiFi hotspot called `cbdfree`.

## I want to make it go away.

Well, the good news is that there are ad blockers for exactly that! Chances are, if you use Adblock, you're using Easylist which was merged with a list maintained by New Zealand's very own [Fanboy List](https://fanboy.co.nz/). He actually had RaGaPa's site in his list so more or less every instance of Adblock will block it by default.
