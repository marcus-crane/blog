## What the heck is this rubbish?

So, I'm sitting at the library using the public WiFi and I visit an unsecured site.

Bam, injected ad frame. What the heck is this?! I run Common Sense 2016, the most up to date antivirus there is!

Even my own site is suffering from this rather ugly defacement! Bah, and people think I'm silly for enabling https even on my static sites. With it enabled, no one has to see how horrible this looks.

I realised later on that I had removed [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) while testing out some different extensions, and forgotten to reinstall it, which is why I'd never had these injections before.

## If it's not me, maybe it's the network!

I had a look in my extensions. Nothing out of place there. Nothing sitting in /Applications
