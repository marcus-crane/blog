### I got caught out by this for quite a while

For those of you who may not have encountered `/etc/rc.local` before while using a Linux distro, it's a file that will run commands placed into it on startup.

Personally, the only two things I use it for, are to fix the tilde key when using Linux (on a Macbook Pro) and to run powertop in order to keep my laptop battery happy.

Most forum posts I've seen state that all you need to do is `sudo nano /etc/rc.local` and add whatever commands you want. Great! Turns out that I'd been blissfully unaware for quite a while now that it wasn't actually working.

Keep in mind I'm like an alcoholic when it comes to trying out Linux distros so I never stuck with one long enough to take much notice.

I looked into it today though and it turns out I was missing a shebang at the top of the file and some proper file permissions.

To make the file executable, we can simply run `sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local` in the terminal.

As for the file itself, mine looks like this at the moment:

{% highlight sh %}
#!/bin/sh -e

# Fix tilde key on startup
echo 0 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/iso_layout

# Auto tune battery life
powertop --auto-tune

exit 0

{% endhighlight %}

Those two scripts should `exit` with a status of `0` anyway but there's no harm in making sure.
