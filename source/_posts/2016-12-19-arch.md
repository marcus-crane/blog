## Some steps towards installing Arch Linux on a Macbook Pro

As a bit of fun, I attempted to try installing Arch Linux on my Macbook.

I didn't actually get there in the end, mainly just because I got fed up (and needed a working OS the next day) but for anyone else interested in making an attempt, here's what I managed to figure out.

It isn't the most efficient order of commands either so take it with a grain of salt.

I should also mention that, **this is not comprehensive enough to give you a fully working operating system!**

Only use this as reference if you're invested enough to figure out the rest of the kinks along the way. **I'm not gonna be responsible if you have any issues.**

#### Keyboard

First things first:

By default, your `~` key will spit out a `<` so we need to fix that

{% highlight sh %}

touch /etc/rc.local
echo "echo 0 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/iso_layout" > /etc/rc.local
source /etc/rc.local

{% endhighlight %}

This part pretty much goes for any Linux OS on a Macbook.

### Connect to WiFi

Next up, we need to connect to WiFi. You can manually use things like the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file but the built in `wifi-menu` command is way easier.

{% highlight sh %}

wifi-menu

{% endhighlight %}

Once you've set up a profile and connected, you can check that you have an IP address assigned with `ip addr` and then ping google to check that you're receiving data with `ping google.com -c 3`

### Partitions

This part was a huge pain in the butt for me

First we need to get the location of your primary hard drive. You can run `fdisk -l` to list all of your hard drives. For me, my primary drive is `/dev/sdb` which may differ for you.

**Note**: *_Going forward, I'll be using `/dev/sdb` but if it's different for you, replace it with your own drive location_*

For myself, I have a 250GB SSD but you'll have to decide what you're after yourself.

The setup I decided on was a 500MB EFI boot partition, 20GB root partition, 7.5GB swap partition and the remainder assigned to `/home`

First step is to run `parted /dev/sdb` so we can specify how we want to set up our partition

EDIT: **NOTE: File locations like [/boot] are just for reference! They are not part of the commands**

Funnily enough, I was using my own guide to install Arch on an Intel NUC and fell into that trap. I've also changed `mklabel msdos` to `mklabel gpt` because I forgot to alter my notes.

As far as the different between UEFI and BIOS requirements, I'm still learning but you'd use GPT with UEFI in order to be able to make an EFI partition?

{% highlight sh %}

mklabel gpt
mkpart ESP fat32 1MiB 500MiB [/boot]
set 1 boot on
mkpart primary ext4 500MiB 20.5GiB [/]
mkpart primary linux-swap 20.5GiB 28GiB [swap]
mkpart primary ext4 28GiB 100% [/home]
Ctrl + C

{% endhighlight %}

Once that's done, checking `fdisk -l` again should show the partition setup like so:

| Device    | Size   | Type  |
| --------- | ------ | ----- |
| /dev/sdb1 | 499M   | EFI   |
| /dev/sdb2 | 20G    | Linux |
| /dev/sdb3 | 7.5G   | Linux swap / Solaris |
| /dev/sdb4 | 205.8G | Linux |

Now that we've specificied the partitions, we actually need to make some file systems for them and activate the swap partition:

{% highlight sh %}

mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sdb1 [/boot]
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2 [/]
mkswap /dev/sdb3 [swap]
swapon /dev/sdb3
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb4 [/home]

{% endhighlight %}

### Mounting the filesystems

With our filesystems created and swap partition activated, we can mount the filesystems in order to start installing our operating system

{% highlight sh %}

mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/boot
mkdir -p /mnt/home
mount /dev/sdb4 /mnt/home

{% endhighlight %}

For anyone wondering why they've never seen `/mnt` before, it doesn't actually exist. In the end, it just resolves to `/`. For example, `/mnt/home` just becomes `/home` and so on.

### Installing base packages

With the filesystems mounted, it's time to install the base Arch packages

{% highlight sh %}

pacstrap /mnt base base-devel

{% endhighlight %}

### Fiddly setup bits and pieces

This is the last little step before we can get a `bash` sh running which should make terminal fans feel more comfortable.

We'll want to generate an fstab template to `/etc/fstab` for later so we can name our filesystems and then use `arch-chroot` to get bash working

{% highlight sh %}

genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash

{% endhighlight %}

Next we'll generate our locale. When you edit `/etc/locale.gen`, you'll see every available locale and you just need to uncomment your respective one. For me, it's `en_NZ.UTF-8`.

For you, it'll just be whichever matches your respective language and country code. You'll likely want to choose the `UTF-8` option if there are multiple choices.

Generate locale

{% highlight sh %}

nano /etc/locale.gen
locale-gen
echo LANG={locale} > /etc/locale.conf

{% endhighlight %}

I hope it goes without saying that **{locale} is a placeholder. Swap it with your own locale eg: `LANG=en_NZ.UTF-8`**

Next, we'll be setting our timezones. Again, just swap NZ for your country code.

{% highlight sh %}

ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/NZ /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc

{% endhighlight %}

### Fix boot order and optimise SSD

This part can be a bit confusing. By default, in your `fstab` file, the boot order of your partitions may possibly be the wrong way around.

For me, `/dev/sdb1` should be set to `01` and `/dev/sdb2` should be set to `02` but they were the wrong way around.

You'll want to edit fstab and make sure they're set correctly.

{% highlight sh %}

nano /etc/fstab

{% endhighlight %}

For some optional optimisation (no idea what, I just saw this somewhere along the way), you can add `discard` to the line `rw,relatime,data=ordered` on the `/home` partition in your `fstab` file.

{% highlight sh %}

rw,relatime,data=ordered,discard

{% endhighlight %}

### Enable fan and temp sensor kernel modules

Apparently the fan and temperature sensor kernel modules aren't enabled by default.

Easily fixed by adding `coretemp` and `applesmc` to `/etc/modules`

{% highlight sh %}

nano /etc/modules

{% endhighlight %}

### Create a hostname for your computer

The hostname is what your computer will be referred to as. If you've seen `username@computername` in terminals before, the computername section is what this hostname will be.

All you need to do is edit it and add your desired hostname. Just the name and nothing else.

{% highlight sh %}

nano /etc/hostname

{% endhighlight %}

You'll also want to add the `hostname` after both `localhost` instances in your hosts file

{% highlight sh %}

nano /etc/hosts

{% endhighlight %}

### Make initial kernel / environment to open partitions

Admittedly, this is where I get a bit lost but I believe we're generating the Linux kernel for our OS? I don't even know what I'm talking about but it's the next step

{% highlight sh %}

mkinitcpio -p linux

{% endhighlight %}

### Set root password

Well, simply put, it's the password used for the root account. You know, for using with `sudo` and what not.

It's as simple as running one command and entering in the password you'd like

{% highlight sh %}

passwd

{% endhighlight %}

### Preserve LAN support for later

I don't recall the exact reason for this but I suppose it's assumed after the upcoming restart that LAN support will be lost. I never had this issue but there's no hard in it anyway.

{% highlight sh %}

pacman -S dhcpcd
systemctl enable dhcpcd

{% endhighlight %}

### Install bootloader for Macbook Pro

Here is where things went sideways for me. As far as I'm aware, these are the correct commands for installing the UEFI bootloader (I never tried using grub2 which may fix this issue)

{% highlight sh %}

pacman -S dosfstools
bootctl --path=/boot install

{% endhighlight %}

### Create a boot entry

We need to make a new entry in the boot segment

{% highlight sh %}

nano /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf

{% endhighlight %}

and then configure it by entering the following

{% highlight sh %}

title Arch Linux
linux /vmlinuz-linux
initrd /initramfs-linux.img
options root=/dev/sdb2 rw elevator=deadline quiet splash resume=/dev/sdb3 nmi_watchdog=0

{% endhighlight %}

Once that's all done, we then set Arch Linux as our default OS for loading like so

{% highlight sh %}

echo "default arch" > /boot/loader/loader.conf

{% endhighlight %}

and reboot in order to carry on with the rest of the setup (Desktop environment and what not)

{% highlight sh %}

exit
reboot

{% endhighlight %}

As I mentioned earlier though, I never got that far since my Macbook never played nice.

This may be of use to someone which is why it's up there but against, **I couldn't guarantee this will work on your system even if I wanted to** so keep some extra alternative distros handy just in case you give up.

The [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro) and [Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBook) wikis are good resources on where to go next as well as Google of course.
