    <h2 id="what-the-heck-is-this-rubbish">What the heck is this rubbish?</h2>

<p>So, I’m sitting at the library using the public WiFi and I visit an unsecured site.</p>

<p><a href="/img/ragapa/mot-injection.png"><img src="/img/ragapa/mot-injection.png" alt="Ministry of Transport face with injection in front of it" /></a></p>

<p>Bam, injected ad frame. What?!? I run Common Sense 2016, the most up to date antivirus available!</p>

<p><a href="/img/ragapa/thingsimade-injection.png"><img src="/img/ragapa/thingsimade-injection.png" alt="Even my own site had it since I disabled https" /></a></p>

<p>Even my own site is suffering from this rather ugly defacement! Bah, and people think I’m silly for enabling https even on my static sites. If a site has it enabled, these ads can’t insert themselves midway.</p>

<p>I realised later on that I had removed <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">uBlock Origin</a> while testing out some different extensions, and forgotten to reinstall it, which is why I’d never seen these injections before.</p>

<h2 id="if-its-not-me-maybe-its-the-network">If it’s not me, maybe it’s the network!</h2>

<p>I had a look in my extensions. Nothing out of place there. A quick poke around the most obvious places turned up zilch so perhaps it was someone, or something on the network?</p>

<p>I spun up <a href="https://wireshark.org">Wireshark</a> and watched the network spew out heaps of requests. It was a public city WiFi after all but thankfully, you can filter by <code class="highlighter-rouge">http</code> to gain some more clarity.</p>

<p>Oooh, what’s that?</p>

<p><a href="/img/ragapa/wireshark.png"><img src="/img/ragapa/wireshark.png" alt="The Wireshark captures from Wellington Library" /></a></p>

<p>Hmm, <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET /api/adscript.jsp</code>? That looks promising.</p>

<p>Perhaps an infected device is serving it up? What if it’s someone hijacking unsecured requests and inserting their own monetisation? I gotta know more!</p>

<p>Thanks to my rookie skills with nmap, I remembered that I could run a scan on it, not just for open ports but also details about its OS as well.</p>

<p><a href="/img/ragapa/cbdfree-nmap.png"><img src="/img/ragapa/cbdfree-nmap.png" alt="nmap output from the Wellington Library scan" /></a></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Too many fingerprints match this host to give specific OS details.</code> Well, so much for that approach.</p>

<p>Maybe the actual ad script itself can give me some clues?</p>

<h2 id="its-usually-quicker-if-you-look-at-whats-right-in-front-of-you">It’s usually quicker if you look at what’s right in front of you</h2>

<p>I loaded up a non-secure site and poked around the DOM.</p>

<p><a href="/img/ragapa/script.png"><img src="/img/ragapa/script.png" alt="Developer tools in Google Chrome showing injected Javascript" /></a></p>

<p>Oh… That address has <a href="http://www.citylink.co.nz/">Citylink Wellington</a> in it who run the actual network itself. I guess it’s nothing malicious after all but still a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>I kept coming across <code class="highlighter-rouge">ragapa</code> references, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">div class=ragapaBottomImage</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">script src=http://adapi.ragapa.com</code> but in wanting to play with Wireshark, I skipped the obvious path of just searching the name. How is that any fun though!</p>

<p>It didn’t take me long before I found an article about RaGaPa.</p>

<p><a href="/img/ragapa/ragapa-article.png"><img src="/img/ragapa/ragapa-article.png" alt="An article about the RaGaPa ad injection device" /></a></p>

<p>They’re a company who provide devices that inject ads into WiFi hotspots. In this case, the entire city wide WiFi hotspot called <code class="highlighter-rouge">cbdfree</code>.</p>

<h2 id="i-want-to-make-it-go-away">I want to make it go away.</h2>

<p>Well, the good news is that there are ad blockers for exactly that! Chances are, if you use Adblock, you’re using Easylist which was merged with a list maintained by New Zealand’s very own <a href="https://fanboy.co.nz/">Fanboy List</a>. He actually had RaGaPa’s site in his list so more or less every instance of Adblock will block it by default.</p>

<p><strong>P.S. At present, I’m looking for my first Junior Dev role!</strong> If you like what you’ve read and are looking to take someone new on board, I’d be happy to chat! All of my contact details are in the footer below.</p>

<p>Like just down there. You probably don’t even need to scroll, just move your eyes down a wee bit. Yeah, those blue icons.</p>
