### UTF-9000

This is the Github copy of my Jekyll blog. The previous theme was my own [UTF-9000](https://github.com/marcus-crane/utf-9000) but now it's using [Simplest](https://github.com/nandomoreirame/simplest).

### Where can I read it?

It's available at [http://blog.thingsima.de](http://blog.thingsima.de).
